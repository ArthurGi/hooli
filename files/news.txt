Intelligence report
A US intelligence report released in January alleged that Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to help Mr Trump to victory.
Mr Trump later commented that the outcome of the election had not been affected.
The report said that Russia's objectives were to "undermine public faith" in the US democratic process and "denigrate" Mr Trump's Democrat rival Hillary Clinton.
